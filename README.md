Fruit Image Classification 

Team:
* Lidio Meireles
* Christopher Reutz
* Saurabh Bhatt
* Pavitra Bagirthi
* Jeff Hartung

Kaggle Database: https://www.kaggle.com/moltean/fruits

The database has 74681 images of 109 fruits/vegetables. We will apply supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms.

Step 1: Feature Extraction (Lidio)
Features will be extracted from images by transfer learning using a pre-trained deep convolutional neural network.

Step 2: Supervised Learning (Saurabh  and Jeff)
Train machine learning model to predict the fruit from image-extracted features.

Step3: Unsupervised Learning (Chris and Pavitra)
Develop image retrieval system that returns images similar to a given query image.

Step 4: Deployment Website (All)
Create a flask application to demo the ML systems.
